# IDEA SHARING WEB APP

## Branching Strategy

We follow the following branching strategy for version control:

### Branch Naming Convention

``` bash
    IDEA-APP/<initial word of first and last name>/<branch name>
```

### Example

If the user's name is John Doe, the branch name will be:

``` bash
    IDEA-APP/JD/<branch name>
```

#### Example Branches

- `IDEA-APP/JD/feature-login`
- `IDEA-APP/JD/fix-ui-bug`
- `IDEA-APP/JD/optimize-performance`

This convention helps in easily identifying the developer or contributor associated with a branch and the purpose of the changes being made.
